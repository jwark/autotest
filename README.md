# autotest

For use during development of a node.js based application. 

`autotest` will watch all the files in the directory that `autotest` was started, and if they change, it will automatically rerun your tests.

# Installation

Either through forking or by using [npm](http://npmjs.org) (the recommended way):

    npm install autotest -g
    
And `autotest` will be installed in to your bin path. Note that as of npm v1, you must explicitly tell npm to install globally as `autotest` is a command line utility.
